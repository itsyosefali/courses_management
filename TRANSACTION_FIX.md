# Transaction Handling Fix - ARG Academy

## 🐛 **Issue Identified:**
From the server logs, I noticed a critical database transaction error:
```
Database error in update_wallet_balance: There is already an active transaction
Critical error in enroll_course.php: There is no active transaction
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The problem was in the `enroll_course.php` file where:
1. A transaction was started with `$pdo->beginTransaction()`
2. The `update_wallet_balance()` function was called, which tried to start its own transaction
3. This caused a "nested transaction" error
4. When the error occurred, the rollback failed because the transaction was already closed

## ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

### **1. Modified `update_wallet_balance()` Function:**
- Added an optional parameter `$existing_transaction = false`
- When `$existing_transaction = true`, the function skips starting its own transaction
- This allows the function to work within an existing transaction

### **2. Updated `enroll_course.php`:**
- Modified the call to `update_wallet_balance()` to pass `true` for the existing transaction parameter
- Improved error handling to ensure proper rollback

## 📝 **Code Changes:**

### **Before:**
```php
// In enroll_course.php
$pdo->beginTransaction();
// ... enrollment logic ...
update_wallet_balance($user_id, $amount, $type, $desc); // Tries to start new transaction
$pdo->commit();
```

### **After:**
```php
// In enroll_course.php
$pdo->beginTransaction();
// ... enrollment logic ...
update_wallet_balance($user_id, $amount, $type, $desc, true); // Uses existing transaction
$pdo->commit();
```

### **Function Signature Updated:**
```php
function update_wallet_balance($user_id, $amount, $transaction_type, $description = '', $existing_transaction = false)
```

## 🎯 **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Eliminates transaction conflicts**
- ✅ **Ensures data consistency**
- ✅ **Proper error handling and rollback**
- ✅ **Maintains atomicity of enrollment operations**

## 🧪 **Testing:**
The fix ensures that:
1. Course enrollment and wallet deduction happen atomically
2. If either operation fails, both are rolled back
3. No orphaned enrollments or incorrect wallet balances
4. Proper error messages are displayed to users

## 🚀 **Status:**
**FIXED** - The enrollment process now works correctly without transaction errors.
